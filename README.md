# INDISPENSABLE

Indispensable is a plugin made for MCS

> We're making this plugin in order to practice programming, and because its fun!
> Our goal is to not use any other plugins but to create all plugins in MCS ourselves!


#### This plugin is basically an alternative to EssentialsX
#### Although I would not understand why one can't just use essentialsX

> Except for me

> The MCS is a private Minecraft server for friends. 
Our aim is to not use any third party plugins and this way practice our programming skills 
throughout the vacation!
